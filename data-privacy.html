            Medium Privacy Policy - Effective date December 31, 2019 through August 31, 2020
            <br> <br>
            Medium Privacy Policy
            Data Protection Statement for European Union Users
            Consumer Privacy for California Users
            1. Medium Privacy Policy
            This policy explains what information we collect when you use Medium’s sites, services, mobile applications,
            products, and content (“Services”). It also has information about how we store, use, transfer, and delete
            that information. Our aim is not just to comply with privacy law. It’s to earn your trust.
            <br> <br>
            Information We Collect & How We Use It
            Medium doesn’t make money from ads. So we don’t collect data in order to advertise to you. The tracking we
            do at Medium is to make our product work as well as possible. This includes basic product functions like
            allowing our metered paywall to work and key features like personalizing what posts you see based on what we
            think you’ll like. So, to give you the best possible experience in using Medium, we collect information from
            your interactions with our Services. Some of this information, you actively tell us (such as your email
            address, which we use to track your account or communicate with you). Other information, we collect based on
            actions you take while using Medium, such as what pages you view (including how much of a given page and for
            how long) and your use of product features (like Save to Medium, highlights, follows, and applause). This
            information includes records of those interactions, your Internet Protocol address, information about your
            device (such as device or browser type), and referral information (how you got to a particular page).
            <br> <br>
            We use this information to:
            <br> <br>
            provide, test, improve, promote and personalize the Services
            fight spam and other forms of abuse
            generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use the Services
            When you create your Medium account, and authenticate with a third-party service (like Twitter, Facebook,
            Apple or Google) we may collect, store, and periodically update information associated with that third-party
            account, such as your lists of friends or followers. We will never publish something through one of your
            third-party accounts without your express permission.
            <br> <br>
            Information Disclosure
            Medium won’t transfer information about you to third parties for the purpose of providing or facilitating
            third-party advertising to you. We won’t sell information about you to a third-party.
            <br> <br>
            We may transfer your account information with third parties in some circumstances, including: (1) with your
            consent; (2) to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) with academic or
            non-profit researchers, with aggregation, anonymization, or pseudonymization; (4) when we have a good faith
            belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (5) when we have a good
            faith belief that doing so will help prevent imminent harm to someone.
            <br> <br>
            If we are going to share your information in response to legal process, we’ll give you notice so you can
            challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we’re prohibited by law or believe doing so
            may endanger others or cause illegal conduct. We will object to legal requests for information about users
            of our services that we believe are improper.
            <br> <br>
            Public Data
            Search engines may index your Medium user profile page, public interactions (such as claps or highlights),
            and post pages, such that people may find these pages when searching against your name on services like
            Google, DuckDuckGo, or Bing. Users may also share links to your content on social media platforms such as
            Facebook or Twitter.
            <br> <br>
            Data Storage
            Medium uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Amazon, for hardware, software, networking,
            storage, and related technology we need to run Medium. We maintain two types of logs: server logs and event
            logs. By using the Services, you authorize Medium to transfer, store, and use your information in the United
            States and any other country where we operate.
            <br> <br>
            Third-Party Embeds
            Some of the content that you see displayed on Medium is not hosted by Medium. These “embeds” are hosted by a
            third-party and embedded in a Medium page, so that it appears to be part of that page. For example: YouTube
            or Vimeo videos, Imgur or Giphy gifs, SoundCloud audio files, Twitter tweets, GitHub code snippets, or
            Scribd documents that appear within a Medium post. These files send data to the hosted site just as if you
            were visiting that site directly (for example, when you load a Medium post page with a YouTube video
            embedded in it, that video appears because of a pointer to files hosted by YouTube, and in turn YouTube
            receives data about your activity, such as your IP address and how much of the video you watch).
            <br> <br>
            Medium doesn’t control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what they ultimately do with
            it. So, third-party embeds on Medium are not covered by this Privacy Policy. They are covered by the privacy
            policy of the third-party service (so, when you watch a YouTube video embedded in a Medium post, the use of
            data about your interactions with the video would be covered by YouTube’s privacy policy).
            <br> <br>
            Some embeds may ask you for personal information, such as submitting your email address, through a form
            linked to from a Medium post. We do our best to keep bad actors off of Medium. However, if you choose to
            submit your information to a third party this way, we don’t know what they may do with it. As explained
            above, their actions are not covered by this Privacy Policy. So, please be careful when you see embedded
            forms on Medium asking for your email address or any other personal information. Make sure you understand
            who you are submitting your information to and what they say they plan to do with it. We suggest that you do
            not submit your email address or other personal information to any third-party through an embedded form.
            <br> <br>
            When posting on Medium, you may not embed a form that allows submission of personal information by users.
            You must link offsite to a page that allows such submissions by users, and that page’s appearance must be
            distinct enough from Medium to ensure it does not cause confusion among users over to whom they are
            submitting personal information. Failure to do so may lead Medium to disable the post or take other action
            to limit or disable your account.
            <br> <br>
            Tracking & Cookies
            We use browser cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you return to our Services. We use
            them in various ways, for example to log you in, remember your preferences (such as default language),
            evaluate email effectiveness, allow our paywall and meter to function, and personalize content and other
            services. Without cookies, our metered paywall would not work, so they are necessary to Medium’s basic
            functionality.
            <br> <br>
            Medium saves data about the URLs you Save to Medium (an optional feature that you may choose to use or
            decline to use), but we do not otherwise track your visits or activities off Medium Services. We track your
            interactions within the Medium Services (which encompasses Medium.com, custom domains hosted by Medium, and
            your interactions with our mobile application).
            <br> <br>
            Some third-party services that we use to provide the Service, such as Google Analytics, may place their own
            cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by Medium only and not the use of cookies
            by third parties.
            <br> <br>
            Modifying or Deleting Your Personal Information
            If you have a Medium account, you can access, modify or export your personal information, or delete your
            account here.
            <br> <br>
            To protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, we may maintain residual copies for a brief
            time period (generally several weeks). But, if you delete your account, your information and content will be
            unrecoverable after that time. Medium may preserve and maintain copies of your information beyond this time
            period when required to do so by law.
            <br> <br>
            Data Security
            We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data
            transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use the Service at your
            own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account.
            <br> <br>
            Business Transfers
            If we’re involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such that your
            information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you in
            advance so you can opt out of any such new policy by deleting your account before transfer.
            <br> <br>
            Email from Medium
            Sometimes we’ll send you emails about your account, service changes or new policies. You can’t opt out of
            this type of “transactional” email (unless you delete your account). But, you can opt out of
            non-administrative emails such as digests, newsletters, and activity notifications through your account’s
            Settings page.
            <br> <br>
            When you interact with an email sent from Medium (such as opening an email or clicking on a particular link
            in an email), we may receive information about that interaction.
            <br> <br>
            We won’t email you to ask for your password or other account information. If you receive such an email,
            please forward it to us at legal@medium.com so we can investigate.
            <br> <br>
            Changes to this Policy
            Medium may periodically update this Policy. We’ll notify you about significant changes to it. The most
            current version of the policy will always be here and we will archive former versions of the policy here.
            <br> <br>
            Questions
            We welcome feedback about this policy at legal@medium.com.

            2. Data Protection Statement for European Union Users
            Description of Processing Activity
            Medium collects and stores personal information about its users to customize their reading experience and
            enable personalized distribution of content. It shares minimal data with its service providers.
            <br> <br>
            Purposes of Processing
            Provide, test, promote, and improve the Services
            Gather usage statistics of services
            Provide customized reading experience
            Publish and distribute user-generated content
            Provide access to paid content
            Pay authors in Partnership Program for certain content
            Fight spam, fraud, and other abuse of services
            Legal Bases
            In order to provide the Services, Medium collects and stores personal data about its users to fulfill its
            contractual obligations to users as described in our Terms of Service and to Members as described in our
            Membership Terms of Service.
            <br> <br>
            Medium also pursues its legitimate interests by collecting minimal data of logged out users to provide the
            Services, as outlined above, as well as to ensure that new users trying out the free member preview do not
            exceed their maximum limit of free articles per month before a paid subscription is required to read
            further. These legitimate interests are not outweighed by (nor do they violate) our users’ privacy interests
            because we collect minimal user data for these purposes and we are fully transparent about these activities.
            <br> <br>
            Where Medium collects and stores personal data about non-users mentioned in user-generated content, it does
            so under performance of contract obligations to users who use the Services to publish content on web sites
            hosted by Medium. In such cases, users authoring such user-generated content containing personal data of
            third parties are responsible for that content. Medium will consider related complaints in compliance with
            the General Data Protection Regulation’s rights of the data subject, as well as rights of expression and
            access to information.
            <br> <br>
            Public Nature of Personal Data
            Logged-in users may choose to interact publicly with the Services in the form of clapping for a post,
            highlighting parts of a post, following other user accounts, sharing links on connected social media
            accounts, or writing original posts. Where such personal data may reveal special category protected data, it
            is processed on the basis that it is manifestly made public by the user. Additional information on potential
            consequences of such processing can be found below. If you do not agree to this public usage, do not create
            an account or use these features of the Services.
            <br> <br>
            Search engines may index your Medium user profile page, public interactions (such as claps or highlights),
            and post pages. Users may also share links to your content on social media platforms such as Facebook or
            Twitter.
            <br> <br>
            Categories of Personal Data Collected
            Logged out users:
            <br> <br>
            Reading history
            IP address
            Browser information
            DNT status
            Logged in users:
            <br> <br>
            Username
            Display name
            Bio
            Avatar image
            Email address (non-public)
            Session activity (security)
            Linked social media accounts (optional)
            IP address
            Browser information
            Reading history (on Medium Services only)
            Meta-data about URLs saved by using the optional feature Save to Medium
            Network interactions (recommends, follows, etc.)
            Posts, responses, or series published by user
            Members:
            <br> <br>
            Billing information and history
            Partner authors:
            <br> <br>
            Bank account for payments
            Business information, if applicable
            Categories of Recipients
            Medium shares minimal personal data with third-party processors in order to provide the Services. These
            processors offer at least the same level of data protection as that set out in this statement. This includes
            the following categories of recipients:
            <br> <br>
            Hosting, Storage, & Other Infrastructure
            Security
            Analytics
            Communication & Support
            Payment Processors
            Payment Processors
            Medium provides Services in conjunction with several payment processors, including: Stripe, PayPal, Google
            Play, and Apple Pay, through which users may pay for Medium memberships or receive payment based on
            participation in our Partner program. Those companies acting as payment processors may collect and store
            personal data related to your billing information and history in order to provide their services, and may
            collect and store personal data and business data to prevent fraud and other abuse.
            <br> <br>
            When you delete your Medium account, Medium deletes your personal data as explained in this policy. However,
            to delete your payment or billing information, you will need to do so with your payment provider, as Medium
            only has minimal secure access to those records as needed to provide the Services.
            <br> <br>
            Use of Algorithms to Personalize User Experience
            Medium collects and stores personal data about its users to customize their reading experience by displaying
            content tailored to the preferences and interests indicated by the users (including through their reading
            history and Services interactions). This does not constitute automated decision-making as that phrase is
            used in the GDPR because it does not produce any legal effects or similarly significant effects for users.
            Medium also moderates content for the purposes of fighting and preventing spam, fraud, and other forms of
            abuse, and may rely on algorithms as part of doing so.
            <br> <br>
            Potential Consequences of Processing
            By creating and using an account on Medium, users may make certain personal data about themselves public and
            accessible to others on their profile and through network interactions. This may in some cases constitute
            special category protected data which is considered manifestly made public by the user.
            <br> <br>
            Due to the public nature of information posted to Medium, it may be possible for third parties to derive
            identifying personal data from posts, whether by reading, inference, supplemental research, or automated
            extraction and analysis.
            <br> <br>
            Users are free to use their real name and information, or a pseudonym of their choosing, for their account.
            Users may also choose to use the service without posting data or engaging in network interactions. However,
            if you do not agree with and accept the risks of such usage, you may not use the Services.
            <br> <br>
            Cross-border Transfers
            Medium is hosted in the United States. By using the Services, you authorize Medium to transfer, store, and
            use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate. Where your data is
            disclosed to our processors, it is subject by contract to at least the same level of data protection as that
            set out in this statement.
            <br> <br>
            Retention
            Medium retains personal data associated with your account for the lifetime of your account. If you would
            like to delete your personal information, you can delete your account at any time. Deleted account profile
            pages will yield an error 404 “file not found” page, immediately upon initiating deletion, and will become
            unrecoverable in our system after a period of fourteen days. It may take several additional days for your
            personal data to be de-indexed from search engines, depending on those search engines’ practices, over which
            Medium may have limited or no control.
            <br> <br>
            To delete your payment or billing information, you will need to do so with your payment provider, as Medium
            only has minimal secure access to those records as needed to provide the Services.
            <br> <br>
            Rights of Data Subjects
            If you sign up for a Medium account, you may at any time request an export of your personal information from
            the Settings page.
            You may correct information associated with your account from the Settings page, and the Customize Your
            Interests page to update your interests.
            You may withdraw consent by deleting your account at any time through the Settings page, which will erase
            your personal information completely within 14 days (except to the extent Medium is prevented by law from
            deleting your information).
            You may object at any time to the use of your personal data by contacting privacy@medium.com. If your
            complaint relates to alleged misuse of your personal data by a third party, it may result in suspension of
            that post or account in keeping with relevant law, public interest, our contractual obligations, and the
            rights of expression and access to information of others.
            Under EU law you have the right to lodge a complaint regarding the processing of your personal data by
            Medium with the dedicated Supervisory Authority of your EU member state.
            Subject Access Requests
            For security and account ownership verification reasons, we process Subject Access Requests and account
            deletion requests from the account holder only. We are unable to process requests made by third-party
            services.
            <br> <br>
            You can access the self-service download tool and account deletion mechanism by logging in to your account
            and navigating to https://medium.com/me/settings.

            If you are a California resident, the processing of certain personal data about you may be subject to the
            California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and other applicable California state privacy laws. Beginning
            January 1, 2020, the CCPA gives you certain rights with respect to the processing of your personal data
            (known as “personal information,” as described in the CCPA).
            <br> <br>
            This section provides additional privacy disclosures and informs you of key additional rights as a
            California resident:
            <br> <br>
            Right to Know Request
            Under the CCPA, you have a right to request information about our collection, use, and disclosure of your
            personal information over the prior 12 months, and ask that we provide you with the following information:
            <br> <br>
            Categories of and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
            Categories of sources from which we collect personal information.
            Purposes for collecting, using, or selling personal information.
            Categories of third parties with which we share personal information.
            Categories of personal information disclosed about you for a business purpose.
            If applicable, categories of personal information sold about you and the categories of third parties to
            which the personal information was sold, by category or categories of personal information for each third
            party to which the personal information was sold.
            To make a verifiable request for information about the personal information we have collected about you,
            please access your account profile to make a request by going to your Settings page here, scrolling down to
            Accounts section, and clicking on Download.zip button to make a request to download your information. You
            may also email us at privacy@medium.com.
            <br> <br>
            Right to Delete Request
            Under the CCPA, you also have a right to request that we delete personal information, subject to certain
            exceptions. You may exercise your right to delete if you have a Medium account by going to your Settings
            page here, scrolling down to ‘Delete account’ and clicking on ‘Delete account.’ You may also email us at
            privacy@medium.com.
            <br> <br>
            Household Requests
            We do not knowingly collect household data. If all the members of a household makes a Right to Know or Right
            to Delete request, we will respond as if the requests are individual requests.
            <br> <br>
            General Requests under CCPA
            If you do not have a Medium account, we will not have enough information about you to verify your Right to
            Know and Right to Delete requests since we do not keep sufficient information to reidentify and link you to
            a prior visit to Medium. You may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information
            twice per 12-month period. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the
            CCPA.
            <br> <br>
            Requests made through Agents
            You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney document, an authorized agent to make requests
            on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require that
            the agent provide proof you have authorized them to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your
            identity directly with us.
            <br> <br>
            Disclosures of Personal Information for a Business Purpose
            In the last 12 months, Medium has disclosed certain data from the following categories of personal
            information to the categories of recipients listed above in the ‘Categories of Recipients’ for one or more
            business purposes:
            <br> <br>
            Logged in users:
            <br> <br>
            Username
            Display name
            Avatar image
            Email address (non-public)
            Members:
            <br> <br>
            Billing information and history
            Partner authors:
            <br> <br>
            Bank account for payments
            Business information, if applicable
            No Sale of Personal Information
            Under the CCPA, a “sale” means providing to a third party personal information for valuable consideration.
            Since Medium doesn’t make money from ads, we don’t collect data to facilitate nor enable third parties to
            advertise to you. At this time and pending final regulations and guidance interpreting the CCPA, we don’t
            believe any of our data practices constitute a “sale” under the CCPA.
